a lovely playgroud for multi-criteria job reccomendations

In this work, we employed a content based recommendation approach with the tool 
svm-rank and scikit learn.

It has been demonstrated that, for users with interaction and impression history,
svm-rank can achieve a recall of 15% w.r.t. 0.5% of simple base line.


Note:
bash file ./run for parallel experiment execution.
